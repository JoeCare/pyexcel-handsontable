**{{name}}** is a rendering plugin to
`pyexcel <http://pyexcel.readthedocs.org/en/latest>`_  and renders
`pyexcel.Sheet` and `pyexcel.Book` into a
`handsontable <https://handsontable.com>`_ in your web page. As long as you
have a browser, you could view the data. However, please note
that this library does not aim to replace any current excel softwares, such
as Micorsoft Office. But it aims to extends the capability of a
Python user/developer in viewing plain data.


Main features:

#. transform your excel sheets into excel alike html file.
#. embed your excel sheets into your web page

Here is one liner to use it with pyexcel:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyexcel as p

    p.save_as(file_name='your.xls', dest_file_name='your.handsontable.html')

Alternatively, you can use this library with pyexcel cli module::


    $ pip install pyexcel-cli
	$ pyexcel transcode your.xls your.handsontable.html


Please remember to give this file suffix always: **handsontable.html**. It is because `handsontable.html` triggers this plugin in pyexcel.
